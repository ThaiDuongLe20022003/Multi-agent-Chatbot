  "query": "I want to know the duration of copyright",
  "response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to figure out the duration of copyright based on the provided documents from the Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988.\n\nStarting with Section 12, which covers literary, dramatic, musical, or artistic works. It says that copyright expires 70 years after the author's death. If the author is unknown, it's either 70 years from creation or if made public within that time, then 70 years from first publication.\n\nThen looking at films under Section 13B. The duration is also 70 years, but this time from the death of the last among the principal director, screenplay author, dialogue writer, or music composer for the film. If some identities are unknown and others aren't, it's treated as known if any were known.\n\nBroadcasts under Section 14 have a shorter duration: 50 years from when the broadcast was made. There's also a note about international obligations affecting this term.\n\nAdditionally, there's mention of unpublished works under former enactments having different durations, but I'm focusing on the main sections here.\n</think>\n\nThe duration of copyright varies depending on the type of work:\n\n1. **Literary, Dramatic, Musical, or Artistic Works**:\n   - Copyright lasts for 70 years after the death of the author.\n\n2. **Works with Unknown Authorship**:\n   - If created by an unknown author, copyright expires 70 years from creation.\n   - Alternatively, if made available to the public within that period, it's 70 years from first publication.\n\n3. **Films** (Section 13B):\n   - Copyright lasts for 70 years after the death of the last surviving principal director, screenplay author, dialogue writer, or music composer.\n   - If some identities are unknown but others are known, the term remains based on the known individuals.\n\n4. **Broadcasts**:\n   - Copyright duration is 50 years from the broadcast date.\n\n5. **Unpublished Works and Exceptions**:\n   - Unpublished works under previous laws may have different terms.\n   - International obligations can affect these durations, particularly for broadcasts.\n\nThese rules apply unless specific exceptions or international agreements alter them.",
